Consider a first-order differential equation in its standard form. We choose and multiply our equation by , givingNoting that , we haveWhen the integral cannot be evaluated, the general solution is where is some convenient lower bound and is a constant of integration.Sometimes we can separate terms containing from those dependent on . This allows us to write By integrating both sides, we are able to remove the derivative terms and solve for . Remark 1 (Constant solutions).\nSometimes it is easy to find a constant solution that satisfies . If we have a differential equation of the form where , , and are continuous functions in a rectangular region such that , then it is an exact differential equation. It follows that there exists a function that satisfies Equations of this form are easily solved by integrating to arrive at written in terms of an unknown function . We then differentiate and solve to determine and consequently, . The final solution is written implicitly as . It is simple to check that differentiating The solutions of the vast majority of first-order initial value problems cannot be found by analytical means. Thus, we are sometimes forced to study the solutions through numerical approximations. One of these is to draw a direction field, but it does not lend itself to quantitative computation. We investigate methods that address this shortcoming.Euler's method is an iterative algorithm that approximates how a function evolves over time based on discrete samples of . At step , we haveTake , so that it satisfies the initial condition of our ODE. Then, we integrateand solve for the constant of integration to satisfy . We continue this process, possibly infinitely, to arrive at a solution. In general,This allows us to generate a sequence . This is useful for proving the existence and uniqueness of solutions.

This requires that is linear in and . Then, we can rewrite the equation as\nIf , the equation is homogeneous.\nFor the purpose of notation, we introduce the differential operator:Definition 2 (Differential Operator Notation).\nLet and be continuous functions on an open interval . We define the differential operator for a twice-differentiable function on as We begin our exploration of second-order linear differential equations by considering the case when . First, consider the case when and are constant. Then,We exploit the properties of by substituting it for :Since is nonzero, we conclude that . This is known as the characteristic equation of this differential equation. We conclude that solutions to the differential equation can be expressed as , where is a root of its characteristic equation.If we have only real roots ( and , distinct), our general solution is .\nIf we have complex roots () and require real solutions, we apply Euler's Formula to arrive at .If we are given a solution , we can find the other solution . We set and substitute into our differential equation. Rearranging, we find that which is a first-order differential equation on . This method tells us that when we have repeated roots, we multiply the second solution by . Intuitively, we restore a degree of freedom that would otherwise be destroyed by the repeated roots, ensuring that we cover all possible solutions with our general solution.What do we do when ?We can write the general solution as , where is the general solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation. This part has no effect on the overall equation as they evaluate to zero when the differential operator is applied. is any particular solution, which we describe how it is found in the following sections.This method applies when and are constants and is a combination of polynomials, exponentials, sines, and cosines. We guess the form of based on :Here is the smallest non-negative integer chosen so that no term in is a solution of the homogeneous equation. Substitute the guess into the ODE, match coefficients, and solve.If is a sum of such terms, find a particular solution for each term separately and add them (by superposition).This method works for any continuous and does not require constant coefficients. Given the homogeneous solutions and , we seek a particular solution of the formWe impose the condition to simplify the derivatives. Substituting into the ODE yields the systemSolving by Cramer's rule giveswhere is the Wronskian. Integrate to find and , then the particular solution isx, xxRemark 3 (Comparison).\nUndetermined coefficients is simpler but limited to constant-coefficient equations with specific forms of . Variation of parameters is fully general but requires computing integrals that may not have closed-form solutions.\nTheorem 4 (Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for Second Order Linear Differential Equations).\nConsider the initial value problem subject to and , where , , and are continuous on an open interval that contains .
